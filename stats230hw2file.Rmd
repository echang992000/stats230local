Problem 7

```{r}
devtools::install_github('https://github.com/echang992000/stats230local',force=TRUE)
library(stats230local)
n=4
N=100
mu=rnorm(n)
sigma=Posdef(n)
x=mvn(mu,sigma,N)
mu
rowMeans(x)
sigma
cov(t(x))
```


Problem 8
When a matrix is ill-conditioned, then QR is generally faster but less stable than SVD. Here our max and min singular values are 17 and 10 respectively, for a condition number of 1.7. This is not a large condition number, so the matrix is well-conditioned and we don't expect to see a large difference between the two methods, as the bench package also indicates.
```{r}
data=read.csv(file="C:\\Users\\Eric\\Downloads\\homework2_regression.csv")
plot(bench::mark(ols_qr(data)))
plot(bench::mark(ols_svd(data)))



```
